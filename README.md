## About using database on DigitalOcean

Mysql database had by default ANSI_QUOTES enabled. This is incompatible with sql statements generated by golang-migrate,
so this option had to be removed.

## Reimport sensor readings

    echo "drop table sensor_reading;" | cat - kilsundvaeret_sensor_reading.sql | /usr/local/opt/mysql-client/bin/mysql -uroot -pdevpass -h127.0.0.1 kilsundvaeret
